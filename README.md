### Hi there 👋

I'm an engineering manager @ [Jahia](https://github.com/jahia/), located in Nantes, France.

📝 Some of my blog posts on [Jahia's Techblog](https://medium.com/@fgerthoffert) or [OICR Softeng's blog](https://softeng.oicr.on.ca/blog/category/francois_gerthoffert)

I'm passionate about Open-Source and enjoy playing with data/observability to help engineering teams improve their practices by better understanding the data they're producing.

##### Open-Source projects:

- 📈 [ZenCrepes](https://github.com/zencrepes), an observability platform for software engineering teams (agile metrics and more). Initially built for teams operating with GitHub issues, it was progressively extended to include more datasets.
- 🖥️ [Jahia-CLI](https://github.com/Fgerthoffert/jahia-cli), a PoC built to demonstrate feasibility and potential ways forward for orchestrating the Jahia platform. Its principles were later integrated as Jahia [provisioning API](https://github.com/Jahia/jahia/tree/master/bundles/provisioning).
- 📈 [Jira Agile Velocity](https://github.com/Fgerthoffert/jira-agile-velocity), an early version built while playing out with Agile data and Jira - Mostly Inactive (see ZenCrepes)
- 📷 [Webcampak](https://github.com/webcampak), a long-term timelapse solution - Inactive

##### GitHub Actions:
- [Metrics for GitHub Projects](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/project-activity-metrics), an action to generate metrics from data (velocity, effort distribution, MTTR, ...) present in a GitHub project. Support MongoDB-style queries to generate a wide diversity of dashboards.
- [Issues from YAML](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-github-issues-from-yaml), an action to generate a large number of GitHub issues from a YAML file containing the specs of the issues to be created. Useful to handle recurring activities.
- [Docker Shorthand tags](https://github.com/Fgerthoffert/actions-docker-shorthand-tags), an action to generate Docker Shorthand tags from existing tags in a repository.
- [Transfer issues with labels](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/transfer-issues-with-labels), an action to transfer GitHub issues between repositories using labels, supports the transfer from private to public repositories (not natively supported by GitHub UI).
- [Create Jira Link](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-link-in-jira-issue), an action add a link to a GitHub Issues into a remote Jira issue. 
- and [more](https://github.com/Fgerthoffert?tab=repositories&q=actions&type=source&language=&sort=)...
