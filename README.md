### Hi there 👋

I'm a delivery manager @ [Jahia](https://github.com/jahia/), located in Toronto, Canada.

📝 Some of my blog posts on [Jahia's Techblog](https://medium.com/@fgerthoffert) or [OICR Softeng's blog](https://softeng.oicr.on.ca/blog/category/francois_gerthoffert)

I'm passionate about Open-Source and enjoy playing with data/observability to help engineering teams improve their practices by better understanding the data they're producing.

##### Open-Source projects:

- 📈 [ZenCrepes](https://github.com/zencrepes), an observability platform for software engineering teams (agile metrics and more). Initially built for teams operating with GitHub issues, it was progressively extended to include more datasets.
- 🖥️ [Jahia-CLI](https://github.com/Fgerthoffert/jahia-cli), a PoC built to demonstrate feasibility and potential ways forward for orchestrating the Jahia platform
- 📈 [Jira Agile Velocity](https://github.com/Fgerthoffert/jira-agile-velocity), an early version built while playing out with Agile data and Jira - Mostly Inactive (see ZenCrepes)
- 📷 [Webcampak](https://github.com/webcampak), a long-term timelapse solution - Inactive
